# Task Management System (Trello Lite)

A simplified task management system inspired by Trello, built with React (frontend) and Node.js + Express (backend).  
It supports secure communication with encrypted requests and responses, role-based access, real-time chat, and task management.

## Features

### Frontend (React)
- **Login Page**: Simulates authentication via email and password (static validation).
- **Dashboard Page**: Displays tasks in three columns â€” To Do, In Progress, Completed.
- **Task Management**:
  - Admin can create tasks.
  - Users can update task status and details.
  - Task details: title, description, status, due date.
  - Drag & drop to change task status (bonus feature).
- **Chat Functionality**: Real-time one-to-one chat between Admin and User.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux Toolkit or Context API.
- **Styling**: Built with Tailwind CSS.

### Backend (Node.js with Express)
- **User Roles**: Admin and User with role-based permissions.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /signup` - Signup with email, password, and age.
  - `POST /login` - Login and receive JWT token.
  - `GET /tasks` - Fetch all tasks (User/Admin).
  - `POST /tasks` - Create a new task (Admin only).
  - `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update a task (User/Admin).
  - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task (Admin only).
- **Security**:
  - Requests and responses encrypted/decrypted using CryptoJS.
  - JWT authentication middleware for route protection.
- **Real-time Chat**:
  - Supports one-to-one chat between User and Admin.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing users, tasks, and messages.
